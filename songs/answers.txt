Judging from this user's danceability and energy scores, they would have a purple aura, characterizing someone who is upbeat and energetic.
However, basing a user's aura just by taking their top 100 scores is not comprehensive of the user's total usage. The top 100 is merely a snapshot into the user's listening behavior. For example, a user may be listening to larger variety of a different genre but because there is not a lot of repetition in plays of one particular song, that genre is not captured in their top 100, hence making this strategy an inaccruate prediciton of someone's aura.
For a more accurate look into someone's aura, it may be helpful to look into all songs a user listened to for a whole year. However, I understand due to bandwidth constraints of processing this large sum of data for millions of users is not a simple feat so limiting the analysis to their top 100 may be the best scenario.
