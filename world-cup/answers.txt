Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: With exponentionally increasing simulations, the run time did not exponentially increase in tandem.
For example, 10 simulations was only 0.001 faster than 100 simulations.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: After 10,000 simulations because the results from the 10K and 100K were the same and the run time for 10K was significantly faster.
